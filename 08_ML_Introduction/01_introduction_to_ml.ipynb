    "**Machine Learning** is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence** that enables systems to **learn from data** without explicit programming. It improves over time as it gains more data.\n",

    "## Applications of Machine Learning\n",
    "- Make robots recognize faces or learn to walk\n",
    "- Discover patterns in user logs, financial data, etc.\n",
    "- Segment customers for personalized marketing\n",
    "- Recommend products based on user behavior\n",

    "## How Machines Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Not so long ago, if you had picked up your phone, opened ChatGPT and asked it what to do in a certain situation, it would have ignored you—and people might have looked at you like you were losing your mind. **Today, it’s normal.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Technology is growing faster than ever, and **Machine Learning (ML)** is at the center of this transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Early Real-World Example: Spam Filter (1990s)\n",
    "- Inbox flooded with unwanted emails\n",
    "- Engineers built systems that **learned** spam patterns from examples\n",
    "- Instead of hard-coding rules (`if \"lottery\" → spam`), the system learned from **labeled data**\n",
    "- Users marking emails → system improves automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "That was **early machine learning in action**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Machine Learning Is **Not**\n",
    "> Downloading hundreds of books onto your computer does **not** make it smart.  \n",
    "> It just stores data. That’s **data storage**, not ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning** happens when a computer **improves at a task** by learning from data and experience—**without being manually programmed for every scenario**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Machine Learning **Is**\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”  \n",
    "> — **Arthur Samuel, 1959**\n",
    "\n",
    "> “A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to some task **T** and some performance measure **P**, if its performance on **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**.”  \n",
    "> — **Tom Mitchell, 1997**\n",
    "\n",

    "|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Task (T)**    | Identify whether an email is spam or not         |\n",
    "| **Experience (E)** | Labeled emails (spam / ham)                    |\n",
    "| **Performance (P)** | Accuracy – how many emails correctly classified |\n",
    "| **Learning**    | System gets better as it sees more examples      |\n",
    "\n",
    "- The examples used to train the system → **training set**\n",
    "- Each individual example → **training instance** (or sample)\n",
    "- The part that learns and predicts → **model** (the “brain”)\n",

    "- Just storing data ≠ Machine Learning\n",
    "- ML = **improving performance with experience**\n",
    "- Learns **patterns from data** instead of hardcoded rules\n",
    "- The **model** makes predictions\n",
    "- One of the earliest use-cases: **spam detection**\n",
    "- Unlike traditional programming, ML systems **adapt** as they see more data\n",
