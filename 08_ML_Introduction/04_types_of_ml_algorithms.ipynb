    "# History of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "> Imagine it’s **1936**. The world is on the edge of chaos.  \n",
    "> But in a quiet university room in England, a 24-year-old genius named **Alan Turing** is thinking:  \n",
    "> _“What if I could design a machine… that thinks?”_  \n",
    "> This wasn’t science fiction. This was the beginning of a revolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Birth of the Turing Machine (1936)\n",
    "- Alan Turing invents a **hypothetical machine** — the **Turing Machine**.\n",
    "- It can simulate **any algorithm** given enough time and tape.\n",
    "- Think of it as inventing the **brain without neurons**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1950: “Can Machines Think?”\n",
    "- Turing publishes the famous paper **“Computing Machinery and Intelligence”**.\n",
    "- Proposes the **Turing Test**:  \n",
    "  > If a machine can fool a human into thinking it’s human → it shows intelligence.\n",
    "- This moment is the **starting pistol for Artificial Intelligence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1957: The First Learning Machine\n",
    "- Psychologist **Frank Rosenblatt** creates the **Perceptron**.\n",
    "- First algorithm that could **learn from data**.\n",
    "- Headlines: _“Perceptron can walk, talk, learn like a baby!”_  \n",
    "  → Oversold, limited, but **planted a seed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1980s: The Quiet Comeback (AI Winter → Revival)\n",
    "- Funding dried up, AI became a joke.\n",
    "- But in labs: **Neural Networks** return with **backpropagation**.\n",
    "- Machines start recognizing handwriting & predicting trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1997: Game Over, Humans\n",
    "- IBM’s **Deep Blue** defeats chess champion **Garry Kasparov**.\n",
    "- Not just brute force — it **learned and optimized strategies**.\n",
    "- “Can machines think?” → now a **warning**.\n",

    "## The Three Ways Machines Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Supervised Learning — Explained Like You’re 10\n",
    "\n",
    "> Teacher holds flashcards:  \n",
    "> “This is a cat.” → “This is a dog.”  \n",
    "> You see picture + answer → learn patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why “Supervised”?\n",
    "- There’s a **teacher** giving **correct answers** (labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Spam Filter\n",
    "- 100 emails → labeled “spam” or “not spam”.\n",
    "- Model learns:  \n",
    "  - “Congratulations!” → spam  \n",
    "  - “!!!” → spam  \n",
    "  - “Click here for money” → spam\n",
    "- New email → model predicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popular Algorithms\n",

    "> **Best when**: You have **labeled data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Unsupervised Learning — Explained Like You’re 10\n",
    "\n",
    "> Dropped in a new city. No map. No guide.  \n",
    "> You notice patterns: suits → office, aprons → chefs.  \n",
    "> You **group** people without being told names.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why “Unsupervised”?\n",
    "- **No labels**. No teacher. Just raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example: Customer Segmentation\n",
    "- Online store data: what customers buy, when, how much.\n",
    "- Model discovers groups:  \n",
    "  - Bargain hunters  \n",
    "  - Big spenders  \n",
    "  - Night-time browsers\n",
